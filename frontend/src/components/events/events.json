      "description": "You Can Dance to Make a Difference!\nOLD SCHOOL DANCE FUNDRAISER\n80's, R&B, Disco, Dusties, Steppin' & House!\nThe Young Masterbuilders in Motion, Inc., (YMIM) a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, is hosting an Old School Dance to raise funds\u00a0to support young adult women orphans, adoptees, and foster youth alumnae. Our participants have aged out of foster care and are enrolled or seeking to enroll in a high-demand trade school certification program, or in a college degree seeking program.\u00a0\nJoin us for great music, board and card games, and LINE DANCE LESSONS for a great cause!\nHelping our young adult women who are foster youth alumnae is critically important. According to the National Foster Youth Institute, after reaching the age of 18, 20% of the children who were in foster care will become instantly homeless. Only 1 out of every 2 foster youth will have some form of gainful employment by the age of 24. There is less than a 3% chance for children who have aged out of foster care to earn a college degree at any point in their life.\nAlthough, those facts are startling, together we can reverse the impact of poverty through educating young women who are foster youth alumnae.\nLearn more about us by visiting the Young Masterbuilders in Motion website at https://www.theymim.org\nThank you in advance for your support.\u00a0And remember, if your employer offers matching funds, your contribution\u00a0doubles!\u00a0\nFor now, just get your dance shoes ready and meet us on the dance floor soon!\nKim Wright, MBA, U.S. Army Veteran\nFounder, Foster Youth Alumna\nYoung Masterbuilders in Motion, Inc.\nLearn more about us at www.theymim.org\nCall us at 773.941.1200.\n\nFAQs\n\u00a0\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\nThe Broadway Armory provides safety officers while the facility is open.
